We can use this to introduce students to the concepts of speed, distance, and time, which are key concepts in mathematics.\n\nHere are some ideas on how to use this website to teach math:\n\n1. Calculating Average Speed: After choosing a city and starting the drive, students can start a timer and use the distance traveled and the time taken to calculate the average speed of the vehicle. This can be done using the formula speed = distance / time.\n2. Understanding Distance and Time: Students can use the website to calculate the distance traveled during the drive by using the scale on the map provided on the website. They can also use the timer to calculate the time taken for the drive. This can help students understand how distance and time are related.\n3. Graphing Speed vs Time: Students can record the speed of the vehicle at different times during the drive and use this data to create a speed vs time graph. This will help them understand how the speed of the vehicle changes over time.\n4. Real Life Applications: You can discuss with your students the importance of speed, distance, and time in everyday life, for example, calculating how long it would take to travel a certain distance by car, bus or train. You can also discuss how these concepts apply in sports, for example, calculating the speed of a runner or cyclist.\n\nIn addition to these ideas, you can also suggest resources for further study, such as Khan Academy or other math websites. The key is to make the math concepts come alive by relating them to the real world, and the website <http://driveandlisten.herokuapp.com/> provides a great opportunity to do just that."

(a) Describe the structure and function of each of the following organelles: mitochondria, ribosomes, and lysosomes. (b) Explain how the structure of a plasma membrane allows it to regulate the movement of materials into and out of a cell. (c) Compare and contrast the mechanisms by which prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells divide. In your answer, be sure to include the role of the cytoskeleton in each type of cell division.\n\nPart (a) of this question asks students to describe the structure and function of three different organelles. This requires both factual knowledge (what each organelle looks like and where it's located in the cell) and conceptual understanding (what the organelle does and how it contributes to the cell's overall function).\n\nPart (b) asks students to explain the structure of the plasma membrane and how it functions as a selective barrier. This requires an understanding of the different components of the membrane (phospholipids, proteins, carbohydrates) and how they interact to control the movement of molecules.\n\nPart (c) is a comparison question that asks students to explain the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division.

Create a `background.js` file in the project directory. This file will contain the logic for creating the context menu and communicating with the content script.\n2.

Add icons for the extension (icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png) in the project directory. You can create or download these icons from a suitable source.\n2. Load the extension in Chrome:\n\na. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.\n\nb. Turn on \"Developer mode\" using the toggle in the top right corner.\n\nc. Click \"Load unpacked\" and select the project directory.\n\nNow, you should be able to right-click on any input field or editable text, select \"Paste predefined text\" from the context menu, and see the predefined text being pasted.\n\nIf"
